### scream

This war talk's spoiling all the fun at every party this spring.

I get so bored I could scream!

Besides, there isn't going to be any war...

Not gonna be any war?

Why, honey, of course there's going to be a war!

If either of you says "war" just once again...

I'll go in the house and slam the door.

But, Scarlett, honey...  Don't you want us to have a war?
