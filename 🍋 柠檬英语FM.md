### go ahead

You get your strength from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.

You're part of it, and it's part of you.

Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara...

the way it was before the war.

Would you? Then go ahead and make it that way.

Spend whatever you want...

make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.

Oh, Rhett.
