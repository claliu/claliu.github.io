### fault

much better from here.

Shocking.

How shall we punish him for such a speech?

We could always laugh at him.

Oh, no, Mr Darcy is not to be teased.

Are you too proud, Mr Darcy?

And would you consider pride
a fault or a virtue?

Because we're doing our best
to find fault in you.

Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive

the follies and vices of others,
or their of fences against me.
