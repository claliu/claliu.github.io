### pineapple

Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

That's... That's about it.
