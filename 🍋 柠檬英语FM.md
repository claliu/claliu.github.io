### patience

At present, I have not room enough
to do them justice.

Well, I think it's amazing
you young ladies

have the patience to be so accomplished.

What do you mean, Charles?

You all paint tables and play the piano

and embroider cushions.

I never heard of a young lady
but people say she is accomplished.

DARCY: The word is indeed applied
too liberally.
