### as for

Dear Charlotte,
thank you for your letter.

I am so glad the house, furniture,
and roads are all to your taste

and that Lady Catherine's behaviour
is friendly and obliging.

What with your departure, Jane's to London,

and the militia to the North
with the colourful Mr Wickham,

I must confess, the view from
where I sit has been rather grey.

As for the favour you ask,
it is no favour at all.

I would be happy to visit you
at your earliest convenience.
