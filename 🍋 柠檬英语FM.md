### manner

I said I'm not interested.

But you promised!

Nothing happens!
They're fiction!

They cease to exist the
moment the novel ends.

But they can't!

I get it in a literary sense
or whatever, but...

I can't do this, Lidewij.

It's impossible
not to imagine what...

I will not indulge
your childish whims.

I refuse to pity
you in the manner

in which you are accustomed.

I do not want your pity! VAN
Of course you do!

Like all sick kids, your
existence depends on it.

You are fated to live
out your days... Peter!

...as the child you
were when diagnosed.

A child who believes there is
a life after a novel ends.

And we as adults, we pity this.

So, we pay for your treatments,
your oxygen machines.

Peter, that's enough.

You are a side-effect
to an evolutionary process...

that cares little
for individual lives.

You are a failed
experiment in mutation.
