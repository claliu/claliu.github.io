### genuine

Wyant, Wheeler aggressively recruited me.

They were the most prestigious firm in Philadelphia...

full of opportunity.

And I was impressed with the partners.

Including Charles Wheeler?  Particularly Charles.

What impressed you about him?

He was the kind of lawyer I thought I wanted to be.

What kind of lawyer is that?

Possessed of an encyclopaedic knowledge of the law...

a razor-sharp litigator, genuine leader.

Gifted at bringing out the very best in others...

and an awesome ability to illuminate...

the most complex of legal concepts to a colleague, a courtroom...

to the man in the street.

The kind of person who can play three sets of tennis...

but doesn't sweat.

Underneath an elegant surface...

he has an adventurous spirit.
