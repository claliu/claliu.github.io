### birthplace

Totally irrelevant.

Do you think that homosexuals deserve special treatment?

Hell, no!  We're in Philadelphia...

the City of Brotherly Love, birthplace of freedom...

where the Founding Fathers authored the Declaration of Independence.

I don't recall that glorious document saying...

anything about all straight men are created equal.

I believe it says all men are created equal.

Gimme a goddamn break.

As far as someone being fired from a law firm or a business...

if we found that their action was discriminatory...

they'd do no business with the city.

Thank you, Mayor.  Yo!

You're not getting a little light in the sneakers, are you, pal?
