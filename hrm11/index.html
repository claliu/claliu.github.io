<p>-What about my blood work? - We&#39;re waiting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I want to prep you for a colonoscopy, take a look inside.</p>

<p>-It sounds delightful. - Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Why do you need to do this?</p>

<p>-Who are you? - Who are you, Dr...</p>

<p>-This is my partner. - Yeah?</p>

<p>He keeps the records of all my hospital visits. It&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m Dr. Klenstein.</p>

<p>Listen, you&#39;re right. A colonoscopy is not a pleasant procedure.</p>

<p>But if the K.S is causing the diarrhea, we&#39;ve got to know about that right away.</p>

<p>No, but it could be parasites, an infection. I mean...</p>

<p>Reaction to the A.Z.T.</p>

<p>All these are possibilities, but we&#39;ve got to go forward...</p>

<p>Listen to me. He&#39;s not going through some painful procedure...</p>

<p>until we cancel out everything else, understand?</p>

<p>-I&#39;m trying to help your partner, okay? - Okay.</p>

<p>-You&#39;re not immediate family. - I&#39;m not?</p>

<p>-I could have you removed from the E.R. - Really?</p>

<p>Look, he&#39;s <strong>upset</strong>. He&#39;s sorry.</p>

<p>No. Don&#39;t apologise for me, okay?</p>

<p>Okay. He&#39;s not sorry. Let&#39;s do this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s find out what the blood work tells us.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to give you a specimen. Some hospital food may help me along.</p>

<p>Then we might hear from Dr. Gillman. We can start from there, okay?</p>

<p>-Everybody happy? All right? - Okay.</p>

<p>-I&#39;ll see the lab about the blood work. - Thank you, Doctor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">ignore</h3>

<p>Um, I&#39;m Augustus Waters.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 18 years old</p>

<p>and I had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year-and-a-half ago.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve lost this baby
as a result.</p>

<p>And, uh, now I&#39;m part
cyborg, which is awesome.</p>

<p>But, really, I&#39;m just
here at Isaac&#39;s request.</p>

<p>And how are you feeling, Gus?</p>

<p>I&#39;m grand, yeah.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a roller coaster that
only goes up, my friend.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;d like to share
your fears with the group?</p>

<p>My fears?</p>

<p>Oblivion.</p>

<p>Oblivion?</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You see, I intend to live
an extraordinary life.</p>

<p>To be remembered.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d say if I have any fears,</p>

<p>it would be to not do that.</p>

<p>Would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that?</p>

<p>Hazel?</p>

<p>Unexpected.</p>

<p>I just want to say
that there&#39;s gonna</p>

<p>come a time when
all of us are dead.</p>

<p>There was a time before humans</p>

<p>and there&#39;s gonna
be a time after.</p>

<p>It could be tomorrow, it could
be a million years from now.</p>

<p>And when it does,
there will be no one left...</p>

<p>to remember Cleopatra or
Muhammad Ali or Mozart...</p>

<p>let alone any of us.</p>

<p>Oblivion&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>And if that scares you, then
I suggest you <strong>ignore</strong> it.</p>

<p>God knows it&#39;s what
everyone else does.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">calm</h3>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>This is more than losing old Frank.</p>

<p>Oh, Rhett...</p>

<p>I&#39;m so afraid.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it. You&#39;ve never been afraid in your life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid of dying and going to hell.</p>

<p>You look pretty healthy, and maybe there isn&#39;t any hell.</p>

<p>Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it.</p>

<p>Well, far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.</p>

<p>Tell me what you&#39;ve done that hell yawns before you.</p>

<p>I ought never to have married Frank to begin with.</p>

<p>He was Suellen&#39;s beau and he loved her, not me.</p>

<p>And I made him miserable. And I killed him.</p>

<p>Yes, I did! I killed him!</p>

<p>For the first time I&#39;m finding out...</p>

<p>what it is to be sorry for something I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>Here. Dry your eyes.</p>

<p>If you had it all to do over again, you&#39;d do no differently.</p>

<p>You&#39;re like the thief who isn&#39;t the least bit sorry he stole...</p>

<p>but he&#39;s terribly, terribly sorry he&#39;s going to jail.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad Mother&#39;s dead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad she&#39;s dead so she can&#39;t see me.</p>

<p>I always wanted to be like her, <strong>calm</strong> and kind and...</p>

<p>And I certainly have turned out disappointing.</p>

<p>You know, Scarlett, I think you&#39;re on the verge of a crying jag.</p>

<p>Shovelin&#39; snow?</p>

<p>I have to get this driveway clean.</p>

<p>And then...</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to congratulate
you on being happy.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause you deserve it.</p>

<p>You said that an hour ago.</p>

<p>Was that tonight?</p>

<p>I just...</p>

<p>saw this tree, but it was a dragon.</p>

<p>Then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.</p>

<p>Okay, Charlie,
don&#39;t freak out. Give me this.</p>

<p><strong>Calm down</strong>.</p>

<p>Look up.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it quiet?</p>

<p>Sam, do you think if people knew...</p>

<p>how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?</p>

<p>All the time.</p>

<p>So you wanna wear these glasses?</p>

<p>Oh, no, you don&#39;t, Chris.
I&#39;m back on at 7.</p>

<p>I know. I <strong>have got to</strong> go to Oakland.</p>

<p>So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...</p>

<p>...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?</p>

<p>-Yes.

<p>Isaac, Hazel&#39;s here.</p>

<p>Hey, Hazel.</p>

<p>How you doing?</p>

<p>I&#39;m doing okay.</p>

<p>It seems Isaac and Monica are
no longer a going <strong>concern</strong>.</p>

<p>Oh, Isaac, I&#39;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Do you want to talk about it?</p>

<p>No, I just want to cry
and play video games.</p>

<p>However, you know, it doesn&#39;t
hurt to talk to him...</p>

<p>if you have any sage words
of feminine advice.</p>

<p>I actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate.</p>

<p>&quot;Pain demands to be felt.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re quoting my book.</p>

<p>She said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery...</p>

<p>because she couldn&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about to lose my eyesight,
and she can&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>I kept saying &quot;always&quot; to her.
Like, &quot;Always.&quot;</p>

<p>And she kept talking over me</p>

<p>and not saying it back, and...</p>

<p>It was like I was gone
already, you know?</p>

<p>You know, sometimes...</p>

<p>people don&#39;t understand
the promises</p>

<p>that they&#39;re making
when they make them.</p>

<p>I know, but...</p>

<p>I feel like such a loser.</p>

<p>I still have her necklace on.</p>

<p>Take it off.</p>

<p>Dude, take that off.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">loose</h3>

<p>&quot;The eyes in the faces he passed on the street</p>

<p>seemed to look inside him and finger his guilt.</p>

<p>But things were out of his control.</p>

<p>He had cut himself <strong>loose</strong></p>

<p>and was drifting faster and faster towards his fate.</p>

<p>...was the dustiness of the floor</p>

<p>the feeling that the clothes</p>

<p>were more next to her than on her</p>

<p>and the sudden realisation</p>

<p>that this would all be for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>I keep thinking about Max.</p>

<p>Wondering where he is.</p>

<p>Me, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it all meant.</p>

<p>Everything he <strong>went through</strong>.</p>

<p>Everything we did.</p>

<p>We were just being people.</p>

<p>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</p>

<p>Are you coming along?</p>

<p>Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.</p>

<p>This is the bus to school.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Forrest. Forrest Gump.</p>

<p>-I&#39;m Dorothy Harris.
-Well, now we ain&#39;t strangers anymore.</p>

<p>This seat&#39;s taken.</p>

<p>It&#39;s taken!</p>

<p>You can&#39;t sit here.</p>

<p>You know, it&#39;s funny what
a young man recollects,</p>

<p>&#39;cause I don&#39;t remember being born.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall what I got
for my first Christmas,</p>

<p>and I don&#39;t know when I went
on my first <strong>outdoor</strong> picnic.</p>

<p>But I do remember the first time I heard</p>

<p>the sweetest voice in the wide world.</p>

<p>You can sit here if you want.</p>

<p>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</p>

<p>She was like an angel.</p>

<p>Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with your legs?</p>

<p>Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.</p>

<p>I just sat next to her on that bus</p>

<p>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</p>

<p>...my back&#39;s crooked like
a question mark.</p>

<p>These are going to make me...</p>

<p>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</p>

<p>Are you stupid or something?</p>

<p>Mama says, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;</p>

<p>-I&#39;m Jenny.
-I&#39;m Forrest. Forrest Gump.</p>

<p>From that day on,
we was always together.</p>

<p>Jenny and me was like

<p>Is Andrew Becket the kind of lawyer who misplaces crucial documents?</p>

<p>Not to my knowledge. No.</p>

<p>If you wanted to make a lawyer look incompetent, would this be a good way?</p>

<p>Hiding an important document maybe for a few hours...</p>

<p>and then making it look like the responsible lawyer misplaced it?</p>

<p>Why would Mr. Wheeler and the others behave so outrageously?</p>

<p>Because they found out Andy was sick?</p>

<p>-He&#39;s not answering the question. -Perhaps.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had lawyers with heart attacks, ulcers, prostate cancer, leukemia!</p>

<p>No one sandbagged them.</p>

<p>Did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally <strong>on purpose</strong>?</p>

<p>-Objection. -I&#39;ll rephrase.</p>

<p>Did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced?</p>

<p>Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Are you a homosexual?</p>

<p>-What? -Answer the question! Are you a homo?</p>

<p>A faggot? A punk?</p>

<p>A queer, pillow biter, fairy?</p>

<p>-Objection! -Order!</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Ferrars. His mother,
who by all accounts is very proud,</p>

<p>has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.</p>

<p>But he refuses to break his promise.</p>

<p>He has stood by her, good man,
and is cut off without a penny.</p>

<p>She <strong>settled</strong> it all on Mr. Robert.</p>

<p>I cannot sup. I must go to Lucy.</p>

<p>Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.</p>

<p>How long have you known?</p>

<p>Since the night Mrs. Jennings
invited us to London.</p>

<p>Why did you not tell me?</p>

<p>Lucy told me in confidence.</p>

<p>I could not break my word.
He loves you!</p>

<p>He made me no promises.
He tried to tell me about Lucy.</p>

<p>He cannot marry her.</p>

<p>Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>But he can&#39;t marry without love.</p>

<p>He promised a long time ago.</p>

<p>He may harbour some regret,
but he will be happy</p>

<p>that he did his duty
and kept his word.</p>

<p>After all,</p>

<p>it is bewitching to think one&#39;s
happiness depends on one person,</p>

<p>but it is not always possible.
We must accept.</p>

<p>Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.</p>

<p>Always resignation and acceptance.</p>

<p>Always prudence and honour and duty.</p>

<p>Elinor, where is your heart?</p>

<p>What do you know of my heart,

<p>Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had
been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.</p>

<p>Go on.</p>

<p>I knew when he came home with a pair
of green socks she&#39;d knitted for him.</p>

<p>That&#39;s quite natural.
I&#39;m sure a jury will find it endearing.</p>

<p>Leonard can be very endearing.
He hates that particular shade of green</p>

<p>and the socks were two sizes too large,</p>

<p>but he wore them just the same
to give her pleasure.</p>

<p>Leonard has a way with women.</p>

<p>I only hope he has an all-woman jury.
They will carry him from court in triumph.</p>

<p>A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know
Mrs French left your husband money?</p>

<p>Yes. A lot of money.</p>

<p>Of course, your husband had
no previous knowledge of this bequest?</p>

<p>Is that what he told you?</p>

<p>Surely you&#39;re not suggesting different?</p>

<p>Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.</p>

<p>Clearly, she had come to look upon your
husband as a son or favourite nephew.</p>

<p>You think Mrs French looked
upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?</p>

<p>I do. An entirely natural
and understandable relationship.</p>

<p>What hypocrites you are in this country.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.</p>

<p>-Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.</p>

<p>You realise your husband&#39;s entire
defence rests on his word and yours?</p>

<p>-I realise that.
- And that the jury will be quite sceptical</p>

<p>of the word of a man accused of murder
when supported only by that of his wife?</p>

<p>-I realise that too.
- Let us, then, at least make sure</p>

<p>-the two are not in conflict.
- By all means, let&#39;s.</p>

<p>I assume you want to help your husband?</p>

<p>Of course I want to help Leonard. I want
to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.</p>

<p>There. Isn&#39;t that
more comfortable for you?</p>

<p>Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.</p>

<p>On the night of the murder your husband
came home before 9.30. Correct?</p>

<p>Precisely. Isn&#39;t that
what he wants me to say?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it the truth?</p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>But when I told the police,
I do not think they believed me.</p>

<p>Maybe I didn&#39;t say it well.
Maybe because of my accent.</p>

<p>My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts</p>

<p>we accept the evidence
of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian</p>

<p>and who must have an interpreter.</p>

<p>We accept the evidence
of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,</p>

<p>as long as they tell the truth.</p>

<p>You&#39;re aware that when you&#39;re
in the witness box you will be sworn</p>

<p>-and you will testify under oath?
- Yes.</p>

<p>Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely
and did not go out again.</p>

<p>The truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth. Is that better?</p>

<p>-Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?
- Leonard thinks I do.</p>

<p>-Well, do you?
- Am I already under oath?</p>

<p>Whatever your gambit may be,
do you know that, under British law,</p>

<p>you cannot be called to give testimony
damaging to your husband?</p>

<p>How very convenient.</p>

<p>We are dealing with a capital crime.</p>

<p>The prosecution
will try to hang your husband.</p>

<p>He is not my husband.</p>

<p>Leonard and I went through
a form of marriage,</p>

<p>but I had a husband living somewhere
in East Germany, in the Russian zone.</p>

<p>-Did you tell Leonard?
- I did not. It would have been stupid.</p>

<p>He would not have married me and
I&#39;d have been left to starve in the rubble.</p>

<p>But he did marry you
and brought you safely here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think you should be grateful?</p>

<p>One can <strong>get</strong> very <strong>tired of</strong> gratitude.</p>

<p>Your husband loves you
very much, does he not?</p>

<p>Leonard?
He worships the ground I walk on.</p>

<p>And you?</p>

<p>You want to know too much.</p>

<p>Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.
Your visit has been most reassuring.</p>

<p>Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him
an alibi and I shall be very convincing.</p>

<p>There will be tears in my eyes when I say
&quot;Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely. &quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re a very remarkable woman,
