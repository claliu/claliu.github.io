<p>-What about my blood work? - We&#39;re waiting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I want to prep you for a colonoscopy, take a look inside.</p>

<p>-It sounds delightful. - Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Why do you need to do this?</p>

<p>-Who are you? - Who are you, Dr...</p>

<p>-This is my partner. - Yeah?</p>

<p>He keeps the records of all my hospital visits. It&#39;s nothing personal.</p>

<p>Oh, I&#39;m Dr. Klenstein.</p>

<p>Listen, you&#39;re right. A colonoscopy is not a pleasant procedure.</p>

<p>But if the K.S is causing the diarrhea, we&#39;ve got to know about that right away.</p>

<p>No, but it could be parasites, an infection. I mean...</p>

<p>Reaction to the A.Z.T.</p>

<p>All these are possibilities, but we&#39;ve got to go forward...</p>

<p>Listen to me. He&#39;s not going through some painful procedure...</p>

<p>until we cancel out everything else, understand?</p>

<p>-I&#39;m trying to help your partner, okay? - Okay.</p>

<p>-You&#39;re not immediate family. - I&#39;m not?</p>

<p>-I could have you removed from the E.R. - Really?</p>

<p>Look, he&#39;s <strong>upset</strong>. He&#39;s sorry.</p>

<p>No. Don&#39;t apologise for me, okay?</p>

<p>Okay. He&#39;s not sorry. Let&#39;s do this.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s find out what the blood work tells us.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to give you a specimen. Some hospital food may help me along.</p>

<p>Then we might hear from Dr. Gillman. We can start from there, okay?</p>

<p>-Everybody happy? All right? - Okay.</p>

<p>-I&#39;ll see the lab about the blood work. - Thank you, Doctor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">ignore</h3>

<p>Um, I&#39;m Augustus Waters.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 18 years old</p>

<p>and I had a touch of osteosarcoma
about a year-and-a-half ago.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ve lost this baby
as a result.</p>

<p>And, uh, now I&#39;m part
cyborg, which is awesome.</p>

<p>But, really, I&#39;m just
here at Isaac&#39;s request.</p>

<p>And how are you feeling, Gus?</p>

<p>I&#39;m grand, yeah.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on a roller coaster that
only goes up, my friend.</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;d like to share
your fears with the group?</p>

<p>My fears?</p>

<p>Oblivion.</p>

<p>Oblivion?</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>You see, I intend to live
an extraordinary life.</p>

<p>To be remembered.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d say if I have any fears,</p>

<p>it would be to not do that.</p>

<p>Would anyone else in the
group like to speak to that?</p>

<p>Hazel?</p>

<p>Unexpected.</p>

<p>I just want to say
that there&#39;s gonna</p>

<p>come a time when
all of us are dead.</p>

<p>There was a time before humans</p>

<p>and there&#39;s gonna
be a time after.</p>

<p>It could be tomorrow, it could
be a million years from now.</p>

<p>And when it does,
there will be no one left...</p>

<p>to remember Cleopatra or
Muhammad Ali or Mozart...</p>

<p>let alone any of us.</p>

<p>Oblivion&#39;s inevitable.</p>

<p>And if that scares you, then
I suggest you <strong>ignore</strong> it.</p>

<p>God knows it&#39;s what
everyone else does.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">calm</h3>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>This is more than losing old Frank.</p>

<p>Oh, Rhett...</p>

<p>I&#39;m so afraid.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it. You&#39;ve never been afraid in your life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid of dying and going to hell.</p>

<p>You look pretty healthy, and maybe there isn&#39;t any hell.</p>

<p>Oh, there is. I know there is. I was raised on it.</p>

<p>Well, far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood.</p>

<p>Tell me what you&#39;ve done that hell yawns before you.</p>

<p>I ought never to have married Frank to begin with.</p>

<p>He was Suellen&#39;s beau and he loved her, not me.</p>

<p>And I made him miserable. And I killed him.</p>

<p>Yes, I did! I killed him!</p>

<p>For the first time I&#39;m finding out...</p>

<p>what it is to be sorry for something I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>Here. Dry your eyes.</p>

<p>If you had it all to do over again, you&#39;d do no differently.</p>

<p>You&#39;re like the thief who isn&#39;t the least bit sorry he stole...</p>

<p>but he&#39;s terribly, terribly sorry he&#39;s going to jail.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad Mother&#39;s dead.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad she&#39;s dead so she can&#39;t see me.</p>

<p>I always wanted to be like her, <strong>calm</strong> and kind and...</p>

<p>And I certainly have turned out disappointing.</p>

<p>You know, Scarlett, I think you&#39;re on the verge of a crying jag.</p>

<p>Shovelin&#39; snow?</p>

<p>I have to get this driveway clean.</p>

<p>And then...</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to congratulate
you on being happy.</p>

<p>&#39;Cause you deserve it.</p>

<p>You said that an hour ago.</p>

<p>Was that tonight?</p>

<p>I just...</p>

<p>saw this tree, but it was a dragon.</p>

<p>Then it was a tree again
and it just lied to me.</p>

<p>Okay, Charlie,
don&#39;t freak out. Give me this.</p>

<p><strong>Calm down</strong>.</p>

<p>Look up.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it quiet?</p>

<p>Sam, do you think if people knew...</p>

<p>how crazy you really were,
no one would ever talk to you?</p>

<p>All the time.</p>

<p>So you wanna wear these glasses?</p>

<p>Oh, no, you don&#39;t, Chris.
I&#39;m back on at 7.</p>

<p>I know. I <strong>have got to</strong> go to Oakland.</p>

<p>So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...</p>

<p>...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?</p>

<p>-Yes.

<p>Isaac, Hazel&#39;s here.</p>

<p>Hey, Hazel.</p>

<p>How you doing?</p>

<p>I&#39;m doing okay.</p>

<p>It seems Isaac and Monica are
no longer a going <strong>concern</strong>.</p>

<p>Oh, Isaac, I&#39;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Do you want to talk about it?</p>

<p>No, I just want to cry
and play video games.</p>

<p>However, you know, it doesn&#39;t
hurt to talk to him...</p>

<p>if you have any sage words
of feminine advice.</p>

<p>I actually think that his
response is fairly appropriate.</p>

<p>&quot;Pain demands to be felt.&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re quoting my book.</p>

<p>She said she wanted to break up
with me before the surgery...</p>

<p>because she couldn&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m about to lose my eyesight,
and she can&#39;t handle it.</p>

<p>I kept saying &quot;always&quot; to her.
Like, &quot;Always.&quot;</p>

<p>And she kept talking over me</p>

<p>and not saying it back, and...</p>

<p>It was like I was gone
already, you know?</p>

<p>You know, sometimes...</p>

<p>people don&#39;t understand
the promises</p>

<p>that they&#39;re making
when they make them.</p>

<p>I know, but...</p>

<p>I feel like such a loser.</p>

<p>I still have her necklace on.</p>

<p>Take it off.</p>

<p>Dude, take that off.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">loose</h3>

<p>&quot;The eyes in the faces he passed on the street</p>

<p>seemed to look inside him and finger his guilt.</p>

<p>But things were out of his control.</p>

<p>He had cut himself <strong>loose</strong></p>

<p>and was drifting faster and faster towards his fate.</p>

<p>...was the dustiness of the floor</p>

<p>the feeling that the clothes</p>

<p>were more next to her than on her</p>

<p>and the sudden realisation</p>

<p>that this would all be for nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>I keep thinking about Max.</p>

<p>Wondering where he is.</p>

<p>Me, too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it all meant.</p>

<p>Everything he <strong>went through</strong>.</p>

<p>Everything we did.</p>

<p>We were just being people.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">outdoors</h3>

<p>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</p>

<p>Are you coming along?</p>

<p>Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.</p>

<p>This is the bus to school.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Forrest. Forrest Gump.</p>

<p>-I&#39;m Dorothy Harris.
-Well, now we ain&#39;t strangers anymore.</p>

<p>This seat&#39;s taken.</p>

<p>It&#39;s taken!</p>

<p>You can&#39;t sit here.</p>

<p>You know, it&#39;s funny what
a young man recollects,</p>

<p>&#39;cause I don&#39;t remember being born.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall what I got
for my first Christmas,</p>

<p>and I don&#39;t know when I went
on my first <strong>outdoor</strong> picnic.</p>

<p>But I do remember the first time I heard</p>

<p>the sweetest voice in the wide world.</p>

<p>You can sit here if you want.</p>

<p>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</p>

<p>She was like an angel.</p>

<p>Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with your legs?</p>

<p>Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.</p>

<p>I just sat next to her on that bus</p>

<p>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</p>

<p>...my back&#39;s crooked like
a question mark.</p>

<p>These are going to make me...</p>

<p>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</p>

<p>Are you stupid or something?</p>

<p>Mama says, &quot;Stupid is as stupid does.&quot;</p>

<p>-I&#39;m Jenny.
-I&#39;m Forrest. Forrest Gump.</p>

<p>From that day on,
we was always together.</p>

<p>Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">on purpose</h3>

<p>Is Andrew Becket the kind of lawyer who misplaces crucial documents?</p>

<p>Not to my knowledge. No.</p>

<p>If you wanted to make a lawyer look incompetent, would this be a good way?</p>

<p>Hiding an important document maybe for a few hours...</p>

<p>and then making it look like the responsible lawyer misplaced it?</p>

<p>Why would Mr. Wheeler and the others behave so outrageously?</p>

<p>Because they found out Andy was sick?</p>

<p>-He&#39;s not answering the question. -Perhaps.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had lawyers with heart attacks, ulcers, prostate cancer, leukemia!</p>

<p>No one sandbagged them.</p>

<p>Did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally <strong>on purpose</strong>?</p>

<p>-Objection. -I&#39;ll rephrase.</p>

<p>Did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced?</p>

<p>Absolutely not.</p>

<p>Are you a homosexual?</p>

<p>-What? -Answer the question! Are you a homo?</p>

<p>A faggot? A punk?</p>

<p>A queer, pillow biter, fairy?</p>

<p>Bootie snatcher, rump roaster? Are you gay?</p>

<p>-Objection! -Order!</p>

<p>Where did this come from? Suddenly counsel&#39;s attacking his own witness?</p>

<p>Mr. Collins&#39; sexual orientation has nothing to do with this case.</p>

<p>Please have a seat, Miss Conine.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">in order to</h3>

<p>Whoever brought in the most money
after six months was usually hired.</p>

<p>Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.</p>

<p>We were all working our way
up call sheets to sign clients.</p>

<p>-From the bottom to the top.
-Yes, sir.</p>

<p>-From the doorman to the CEO.
-Okay.</p>

<p>They&#39;d stay till 7,
but I had Christopher.</p>

<p>I had to do in six hours
what they do in nine.</p>

<p>Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I&#39;m calling from Dean Witter.</p>

<p><strong>In order</strong> not <strong>to</strong> waste any time...</p>

<p>... I wasn&#39;t hanging up the phone
in between calls.</p>

<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

<p>I realised that
by not hanging up the phone...</p>

<p>... I gained another eight minutes
a day.</p>

<p>Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.</p>

<p>-I&#39;m calling from Dean Witter.
-I wasn&#39;t drinking water...</p>

<p>... so I didn&#39;t waste any time
in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;d love to have
the opportunity...</p>

<p>Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.</p>

<p>But even doing all this...</p>

<p>... after two months, I still didn&#39;t have
time to work my way up a sheet.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">thunder</h3>

<p>All I have learned is
that life makes no promises.</p>

<p>So I had better get started.</p>

<p>I have always
tried to ignore it...</p>

<p>but I know this all
started with a train...</p>

<p>and some snow...</p>

<p>and my brother.</p>

<p>Outside the car, the world was
thrown inside a snow-shaker.</p>

<p>Und on a place
called Heaven Street...</p>

<p>a man with an accordion heart und
a woman cloaked in <strong>thunder</strong>...</p>

<p>waited for their new daughter.</p>

<p>He lived under our stairs like
a quiet owl with no wings...</p>

<p>until the sun forgot
what his face was.</p>

<p>The book floated
down the river...</p>

<p>like a red fish being chased
by a yellow-haired boy.</p>

<p>For Max, who gave me eyes.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="toc_15">entire</h3>

<p>So how are your eyes, Isaac?</p>

<p>They&#39;re good.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not in my head,
is the only problem.</p>

<p>Besides that...</p>

<p>Well, um, it appears my <strong>entire</strong>
body&#39;s made out of cancer now.</p>

<p>So, sorry to
one-up you, dude.</p>

<p>Did you, uh...
write his eulogy yet?</p>

<p>Dude.
What?</p>

<p>What? I haven&#39;t told
her yet, Isaac.</p>

<p>What are you talking about?</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

<p>Augustus?</p>

<p>I need speakers at my funeral.</p>

<p>So, I was hoping
that you and Isaac,</p>

<p>but mostly you...</p>

<p>would be, um,</p>

<p>kind enough
to whip something up.</p>

<p>I would love to do that.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">entirely</h3>

<p>Lizzie, are you out of your senses?
I thought you hated the man.</p>

<p>-No, Papa.
-He is rich, to be sure.</p>

<p>And you will have
more fine carriages than Jane.</p>

<p>But will that make you happy?</p>

<p>Have you no other objection
than your belief in my indifference?</p>

<p>None at all.</p>

<p>We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.</p>

<p>But this would be nothing
if you liked him.</p>

<p>I do like him.</p>

<p>I love him.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not proud. I was wrong.
I was <strong>entirely</strong> wrong about him.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know him, Papa.
If I told you what he was really like,</p>

<p>what he&#39;s done...</p>

<p>What has he done?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="toc_17">power</h3>

<p>I&#39;d like you to take a
look at something for me.</p>

<p>Tell me what you think.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a fake.</p>

<p>How do you know?</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t looked at it.</p>

<p>Well, there&#39;s
no perforated edge, right?</p>

<p>I mean, this... this check
was hand-cut, not fed.</p>

<p>Yeah...</p>

<p>Paper is double-bonded</p>

<p>much too heavy
to be a bank check.</p>

<p>Magnetic ink, it&#39;s, uh,
raised against my fingers</p>

<p>instead of flat.</p>

<p>And this doesn&#39;t
smell like MICR.</p>

<p>It&#39;s some kind of a...</p>

<p>you know, some kind
of a drafting ink.</p>

<p>You know, the kind you get
at a stationery store.</p>

<p>Frank...</p>

<p>would you be interested
in working</p>

<p>with the FBI&#39;s
Financial Crimes Unit?</p>

<p>I already got a job here.</p>

<p>You know, I, uh,
deliver the mail.</p>

<p>Frank, we have the <strong>power</strong>
to take you out of prison.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be placed in
the custody of the FBI</p>

<p>where you&#39;d serve out the
remainder of your sentence</p>

<p>as an employee of
the federal government.</p>

<p>Under whose custody?</p>
